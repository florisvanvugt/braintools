# The "x" key of the plot determines which variable goes on the x-axis. It can be from the
# phenotype file (in which case we will collapse across multiple entries per subject)
# or from the design_rows_file.
# The "y" key determines what regressor we show on the y axis, where None means showing just the value of the cluster
